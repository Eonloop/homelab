### Packer Golden Images


I utilize Packer as my tool to build golden images in my Proxmox Cluster in my homelab.

I've started off with a template for Debian 13 - Trixie, this is the primary operating system I utilize for my VMs as it's rock solid stable and is free of extra bells and whistles

Packer allows me to provision a Golden Image template for Debian that I maintain on a bi-weekly cadence.
